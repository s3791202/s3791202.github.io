									<h1>Project<br />
									Ideas</h1>
								</header>
                                <b/><p/>Overview<b\></b><p/>
								The project I would like to work on would be a challenging one to create but it can help many people these days. I would call my project “YouTube Guard”. The idea of the project is to protect the viewers of YouTube from harmful content in the videos that they or their children may encounter. That can include nudity, graphic violence, horrible videos that can frighten children, bullying videos etc. I believe it’s important to protect billions of viewers from negative experience of witnessing uninvited content in their homes or on the go using their smartphones, also it is crucial to protect young viewers from inappropriate content as well as from being taught harmful or destructive behaviour. Every parent would agree on that!
								
								<b/><p/> Motivation<p\></p><b\></b>

								In spite the fact that YouTube does not permit that type of videos on their website, it is impossible to track all the videos that are uploaded daily. Statistics says that over 65 000 videos get uploaded every day, which is impossible to monitor for content with purely YouTube employees. In that regards viewers don’t have a guaranteed protection-only “flagging the video content” option is available which is not always reliable because not every inappropriate video is being flagged and reported, so it leaves us with no many options on how to protect ourselves from uninvited content. The motivation behind this project was the recent incendent that had shook the world- suicidal tutorials hacked into children’s’ cartoons. That made the viewers realise the vulnerability of YouTube, and especially the exposure of evil content in videos for children. That inspired me to create a software that analyses imaging, audio and coding in videos. I believe it will be in demand by many parents and will give them reassurance when their children watch videos on YouTube.
								
							
							
                            <p/><b/><p/>Description<b\></b><p/><p/>
							 
							Creating and maintaining software requires finances, so I would have to be charging a $5 subscription monthly fee to be able to run the software. This product can be installed on every web browser of the viewers choosing. It’s easy and quick to install and would take only a few minutes to install it on person’s computer or mobile phone, and it will perform sound and image analysis.
 This high advanced technology is able to recognize if there is coding that has been tampered with and will be searching for inappropriate images that the programme will be able to pick up and block. The programme will have a self learning software that identifies any problem with the video content. For example, it will search for the codes that have been changed or added to the video that doesn’t match the original code. It will also search the images that the programme will be designed to recognise as inappropriate content. Also, for kids videos it will recognize if the images of the cartoon characters match the original. An addition to that an audio detector will also be implemented into the programme running at all times and monitoring sound of the videos to look for words that are considered to be threatening, with evil or inappropriate content.  The programme will have a library of words that are built into the programme to detect and block them.  The programme will be able to search through the content and leave a report of everything that it had found as a suspicious content.  In general words it will incorporate a set of tasks to search for video content, audio, images and coding. 
In instance when it finds any content or coding that has been corrupted, it automatically deletes all the inappropriate content out of the video and sends a copy of the report to YouTube to flag the video.
In order to be able to check the videos for the inappropriate content the customer would have to download the app on their desktop, and it would be an add on to customer’s web browser where it would monitor YouTube activity. 
One of the obstacles of the programme would be the inability of the software to recognise the words or images that it’s not programmed for. But it would be getting updated on a regular basis. Another challenge might if the programme has difficulties recognising the corrupt image due to internet issues such as buffering. 

<p/><b/><p/>Tools and Technologies<b\></b><p/><p/>

The tools to be used for the programme would be- JavaScript and Python for detecting corrupted codes in the videos. The audio analysis will be performed using artificial intelligence that would be designed using Python. Artificial intelligence would be able to recognise words that are inappropriate. And image analysis cab be performed through Java. The challenging thing would be to incorporate all these tools in one programme, and make it run effectively. 

							<p/><p\></p><p\></p>
							<p/><b/><p/>Skills and requirements<b\></b><p/><p/>

							Skills required for creating this programme would be a deeper understanding and expertise in using JavaScript and Python. Also, skills required would be having an understanding of image analysis and how to implement it on the videos. For the audio analysis there has to be an understanding on how to create artificial intelligence that is programmed to detect listed voice commands.
							
							<p/><b/><p/>Outcome<b\></b><p/><p/>

If this programme is successful, I believe it will be very helpful and beneficial for a lot of people. Currently YouTube doesn’t have enough stuff members to solve this problem manually through monitoring each video, that’s where this programme steps in to solve this problem. Many parents will be able to relax and let their kids watch YouTube videos while being busy with something else. They won’t have to always check every video making sure it’s safe for their child to watch it. This programme will put a person’s mind to peace while watching videos for the first time and will help make YouTube a much safer place for billions of viewers. YouTube was once created as a video sharing website and was designed to help audience share videos without any difficulties, but when the website grows to nearly2 billion users every month things like safety become an issue. I believe that with this software people will be able to go back to the original idea of YouTube website- safe video sharing.
